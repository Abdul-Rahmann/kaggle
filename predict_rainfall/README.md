# Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset  
## Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 3  

### **Overview**  
Welcome to the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series!** This series continues the tradition of offering interesting and approachable datasets for the Kaggle community to practice machine learning skills. A new competition is anticipated each month.  

#### **Goal**
Your goal is to predict **rainfall** for each day of the year.

### **Timeline**  
- **Start Date:** March 1, 2025  
- **Final Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025  
- **Entry Deadline:** Same as the Final Submission Deadline  
- **Team Merger Deadline:** Same as the Final Submission Deadline  

> All deadlines are at **11:59 PM UTC** unless otherwise noted.

### **Evaluation**  
Submissions are evaluated on the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)** between the predicted probability and observed target.  

#### **Submission File**  
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict a probability for the target (`rainfall`). The file should contain a header and follow the format below:  

id,rainfall 2190,0.5 2191,0.1 2192,0.9 etc.

### **About the Tabular Playground Series**  
The **goal** of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide Kaggle users with light-weight challenges to practice and enhance their skills in machine learning and data science.  

#### Key Features:
- Competitions typically last **a few weeks.**
- Datasets are **synthetically generated** from real-world data to provide interesting yet private test labels.
- Encourages iterative experimentation with **model building, feature engineering**, and visualization.

> **Why Synthetic Data?**  
Using synthetic data strikes a balance between:
1. Representing **real-world features**.
2. Ensuring **test labels remain private.**  
The datasets are designed to minimize artifacts for better competition quality. Feedback on datasets is welcome to help improve future competitions.
